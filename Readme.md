## Tea Station Project

This project was designed and implemented by <strong>Kosisochukwu Emmanuel (Nuelsage)</strong> using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project was to create a website that provided information about a fictional tea shop and its products.

## Layout

The website's layout was created using floats, without the use of CSS Grid or Flexbox. The various elements of the website, including the header, navigation, and content sections, were positioned using floats.

## Design

The website's color scheme and overall aesthetic were inspired by traditional tea houses, with warm earthy tones and calming imagery. The design aimed to create a relaxing and inviting atmosphere for visitors to the website.

## Interactive Features

JavaScript was used to create some interactive features, including a dropdown menu in the navigation bar and a slideshow of product images. These features added functionality and interactivity to the website, making it more engaging for visitors.

## Conclusion

The Tea Station project provided a great opportunity for me to practice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing website. Despite not using advanced layout tools like Grid or Flexbox, the project was successful in achieving its goals and providing a pleasant user experience.
